## Key Insights

**1. Remote work offers more compensation compared to hybrid or office based work setting.** This may be so because: The company may have saved some overhead costs like office space           cost, thus transfering this cost to the salaries of its employess. Another reason could be the fact that the company wants to attract more talents worldwide, so they offer huge           incentives to attract these talents. Lastly, there are specific skills which are well offered remotely and may be difficult to find locally, so companies may pay premium to get           these skillset.

**2. Consultants presented to part with a huge chunk of salary followed by full-time employers with part-time employees earning the least.** A reason for this could be the fact that consultants bring specialized skills and expertise to the table, attracting a higher compensation rate. Secondly, companies engage consultants for specific projects which are usually short-term. The payment terms may differ based on hourly rates or project fees unlike the basic pay for a part-time and full-time employee.

**3. Executives and senior levels presented to have a bigger pay compared to entry level roles,** basically because of the level of expertise for the senior roles and also the kind of demands these roles calls for. Executives are also responsible for critical decisions which reflects on the company's overall performance. Therefore, a higher compensation reflects on their level of accountability and risk involved.

**4. Entry level and middle level roles maintained almost an equal pay in the years 2020, 2021 and 2022.** However, for the executive and senior roles, the salary range kept on fluctuating in these years. This could be influenced by economic and company performance, may be companies couldn't afford top talents because they were struggling, or the fact that there was a high competition for such talents. Or a surplus of qualified candidates in the same field.
